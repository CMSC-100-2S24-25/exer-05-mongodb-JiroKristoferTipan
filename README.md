## Code Description

- This code makes use of 4 different files, the server file which is run to start the local host and has the listener for the localhost, the router file which is where all the paths are declared, the controller file which has all the logic on what happens when running one of the specified paths in router, and finally the request file which is where I use needle to input queries in post commands.
